Build Tools
===========

* polybuild

This script builds a collection of different programs on multiple
hosts.  Currently it can only build bzr and git branches, but it could
be adapted to other VCSs if necessary.

See polybuild.conf for an example configuration.

* stabilize

This script pushes changes from a 'development' branch to a 'stable'
branch provided the branch continues to build.

Please send feedback to Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>.
