run-builds
==========

This is a Perl script which builds a collection of different programs
on multiple hosts.  Currently it can only build bzr branches, but it
could be adapted to other VCSs if necessary.

Run 'make' to build run-builds.txt, the documentation, or just read
the POD messages inside the script.

Please send feedback to Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>.
