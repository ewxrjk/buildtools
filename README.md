Build Tools
===========

polybuild
---------

This script builds a collection of different programs on multiple
hosts.  Currently it can only build bzr and git branches, but it could
be adapted to other VCSs if necessary.

See polybuild.conf for an example configuration.

stabilize
---------

This script pushes changes from a 'development' branch to a 'stable'
branch provided the branch continues to build.

Please send feedback to Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>.

Installation
------------

    autoreconf -si        # unless configure already exists
    ./configure
    make check
    sudo make install
    man polybuild
    man stabilize
